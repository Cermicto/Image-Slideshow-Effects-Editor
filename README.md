# Image-Slideshow-Effects-Editor v0.0.0.0
An image slideshow and effects editor where you can apply various animations and special effects

## Purpose of this Project
Instead of building an entire project before pushing it to GitHub this project is aimed at examining the building iterations of the entire project itself. So each commit for each smaller portion of code additions and changes is recorded for examination of how I work through a project.

## Updates to README
Here I'll provide updates on where the project is, what I want to do with it, and other fixes and the like.

### Current State
2/21/2025 ~10:50PM CST:
- Got the image slideshow up and running with an initial fade in and out animation of the current and next frames.
- Set up basic JavaScript to keep track of current images and transition to next slide based on direction (currently set to "previous" so it goes from the first to the last then the keeps going backwards right now)

### To-Dos (lots)
- Add animation controls UI to select animation type, duration, timing, etc.
- Add effect controls UI to change the look of the image and other things pertaining to the image
- Add a bunch of different animations and effects
- Make pause, next, and previous button controls for user control of the current image (so take it out of slideshow mode)
- Add UI controls for adjusting levels and speeds; probably after adding simpler input boxes, UI preview inputs for animation and effect selection
- Refactor code (always in progress)

### Future Integrations
- I'd like to make it part of a web app with a node.js backend, and API calls with preloading upcoming images
- I'd like to allow user accounts and uploading of user images to create custom slideshows they can then just download the completed saved slideshow and put it on their website
- I'd like to integrate generative AI image collection generation through AI APIs
